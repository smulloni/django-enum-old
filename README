**N.B.:** This project is obsolete/retired. You probably don't want it
but is here for reference, or in case anyone has a dependency on it.

This package contains a tiny convenience class, ChoiceEnum, I find
myself always adding to Django projects.  If you need it, it is
self-explanatory; otherwise, it is of no conceivable interest.
